Recently, our college was selected among 20 others in kerala where a fabrication lab (FABLAB) was to be setup. It gives me great pleasure to document and share my FABLAB experiences with you using this platform.

### DAY 1 (2 AUGUST 2017 )

I was very excited today to attend the FABLAB training and being part of the very 1st batch of students undergoing hands-on training in this well equipied lab. Our trainer was Mr. Mohammed Jaseel. Jaseel sir is very informative and he indroduced us to fablab. He gave an overview of this course which i felt well structured and interesting. 

### DAY 2 ( 3 AUGUST 2017 )

Today he indroduced us to various equipments in the lab.

### 3-D PRINTING

3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file.

The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.
